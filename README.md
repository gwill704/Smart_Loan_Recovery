# Smart_Loan_Recovery

Practice for ML &amp; AI learning path, here we dive into creatind a Smart Loan Recovery system, with target client banks, in order to evaluate risks of loan and probability of recovery, from data.

## Dataset Overview

First we'll study the borrower profiles, loan details and repayment stories.

+ **Demographic Information**: Age, employment type, income level, and number of dependents

+ **Loan Details:** Loan amount, tenure\*, interest rate, and collateral value. 

+ **Repayment History:** Number of missed payments, days past due, and monthly EMI payments. 

\* tenure: The loan tenure meaning in banking is the total duration of time over which you spread your loan EMI payments to pay off the entire loan amount.

+ **Collection Efforts**: Collection methods used, number of recovery attemps, and legal actions taken.

+ **Loan Recovery Status:** Whether the loan was fully recovered, partially recovered, or remains outstanding.

OBJECTIVE: We must optimize the loan recovery process by identifying the best strategies based on borrower profiles, outstanding loan amounts, and past recovery outcomes. 

Using historical data, your task is to develop a Loan Recovery Strategy Model that predicts each delinquent borrowerâ€™s most effective recovery method to maximize loan recovery while minimizing costs.

Here are the problems you need to solve:

    + Identify borrower segments based on attributes such as loan amount, monthly income, payment history, and missed payments.
    + Optimize collection methods (e.g., legal action, settlement offers, debt collectors, phone calls) to increase recovery rates.
    + Minimize recovery costs while maximizing the amount recovered.
    + Develop an early warning system to flag borrowers who are at high risk of default.
