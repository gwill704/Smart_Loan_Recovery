    "## Why Fully Recovered loans still have an Outstanding Loan Amount\n",
    "\n",
    "If a loan is Fully Recovered, the Outstanding_Loan_Amount should ideally be zero. However, there are a few reasons why a fully recovered loan might still show an outstanding balance in your system:\n",
    "1. Data Entry or System Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "    The system might not be updating the Outstanding_Loan_Amount correctly after full repayment.\n",
    "    There could be a delay in marking the loan as fully recovered after the final payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accrued Interest or Fees\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the borrower repaid only the principal but had outstanding late fees, penalties, or interest, the system might still consider an amount due.\n",
    "    Some financial institutions apply fees separately from the loan amount, which may not automatically be cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Technical Issues in the Loan Repayment Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Outstanding_Loan_Amount might be incorrectly computed, especially if partial payments were made over time.\n",
    "    Rounding errors in calculations could lead to small remaining balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loan Forgiveness or Settlement\n",
    "\n",
    "    In some cases, a loan is marked as fully recovered even if the borrower didn't pay the full amount (e.g., through a negotiated settlement).\n",
    "    The remaining amount might still be visible in the system but is not expected to be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a loan is truly fully recovered, ensure that the Outstanding_Loan_Amount is set to zero in your database.\n",
    "    Verify whether late fees or interest are still being applied even after the final payment.\n",
    "    Check if there’s a delay in the system updating loan statuses."

    "## What is a Settlement Offer\n",
    "\n",
    "A Settlement Offer is a proposal made by a lender to a borrower to resolve a debt for less than the total outstanding amount. It is commonly used in loan recovery to recover at least part of the debt rather than risking a full default.\n",
    "🔹 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "    The lender offers the borrower the option to pay a reduced amount as a one-time lump sum or through a short-term payment plan.\n",
    "    If the borrower accepts and pays the agreed amount, the loan is considered settled, even though the full balance was not paid.\n",
    "    The lender may report the loan as \"Settled\" instead of \"Fully Paid\", which can impact the borrower's credit score.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "    A borrower owes $10,000 in a loan, but due to financial hardship, they cannot repay the full amount.\n",
    "    The lender offers a settlement of $6,500, allowing the borrower to pay this amount and close the loan.\n",
    "    Once the borrower pays the $6,500, the remaining $3,500 is forgiven, and the account is marked as settled.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why Do Lenders Offer Settlements?\n",
    "\n",
    "    To recover some money instead of losing everything if the borrower defaults.\n",
    "    To avoid legal action, which can be costly and time-consuming.\n",
    "    To clear bad debts from their books and improve financial stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Impact on Borrowers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reduces financial burden.\n",
    "    Avoids legal action or collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    May hurt the borrower's credit score.\n",
    "    May limit access to future loans.\n",
    "    Some lenders may require proof of financial hardship before offering a settlement."
